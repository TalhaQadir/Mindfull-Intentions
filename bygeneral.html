<b><h5 class="p-3 heading text-center"><u><b><h5 class="heading text-center">Walking:


</h5></b></u></h5></b>
<h5 class="p1 mt-3">Any exercise program should include cardiovascular exercise, which strengthens the heart and burns calories. And walking is something you can do anywhere, anytime, with no equipment other than a good pair of shoes. It's not just for beginners, either: Even the very fit can get a good workout from walking. "Doing a brisk walk can burn up to 500 calories per hour," says Robert Gotlin, DO, director of orthopaedic and sports rehabilitation at Beth Israel Medical Center in New York. Since it takes 3,500 calories to lose a pound, you could expect to lose a pound for every seven hours you walk, if you did nothing else.
</h5>
<b><h5 class="p-3 heading text-center"><u><b><h5 class="heading text-center">Squats:


</h5></b></u></h5></b>

<h5 class="p1 mt-3">Squats Strength training is essential, the experts say. "The more muscular fitness you have," says Cotton, "the greater the capacity you have to burn calories." And our experts tended to favor strength-training exercises that target multiple muscle groups. Squats, which work the quadriceps, hamstrings, and gluteals, are an excellent example. "They give you the best bang for the buck because they use the most muscle groups at once," says Oldsmar, Fla., trainer David Petersen. Form is key, though, warns Petersen. "What makes an exercise functional is how you perform the exercise," he says. "If you have bad technique, it's no longer functional." For perfect form, keep feet shoulder-width apart and back straight. Bend knees and lower your rear, says Cotton: "The knee should remain over the ankle as much as possible."

</h5>
<b><h5 class="p-3 heading text-center"><u><b><h5 class="heading text-center">Lunges
  :
</h5></b></u></h5></b>
<h5 class="p1 mt-3">Lunges Like squats, lunges work all the major muscles of the lower body: gluteals, quadriceps, and hamstrings. A lunge is a great exercise because it mimics life, it mimics walking," only exaggerated, says Petersen. Lunges are a bit more advanced than squats, says Cotton, helping to improve your balance as well. Here's how to do them right: Take a big step forward, keeping your spine in a neutral position. Bend your front knee to approximately 90 degrees, focusing on keeping weight on the back toes and dropping the knee of your back leg toward the floor. Petersen suggests that you imagine sitting on your back foot. "The trailing leg is the one you need to sit down on," he says. To make a lunge even more functional, says Rufa, try stepping not just forward, but back and out to each side."
