              <h5 class="p1">Riding a bike, lifting weights, sweating it out on a treadmill—each can be a mindfulness practice. Whatever the physical activity, instead of simply working out to master a skill or improve your condition, you can move and breathe in a way that shifts you from feeling busy and distracted to feeling strong and capable</h5>

                  <h5 class="p1">Mindful movement allows us to check in with our bodies and get moving in a way that can help us lower stress, release stagnant energy, and strengthen our mind-body connection. It’s a great way to practice self-care by incorporating both mental and physical well-being. Oftentimes, when we engage in mindful movement to help our body feel better, our mood is uplifted, too.</h5>

               <u> <b><h5 class="heading text-center">Mindful Movement Meditation </h5></b></u>
               
               <h5 class="p1 mt-5">Any activity can work for mindful meditation, and you can find anchors for your attention in the motions: Maybe it’s the point when your right hand enters the water while you swim, or the contact of your feet on the pavement as you run. Weight lifters might use the up-and-down repetition of a barbell. Or, you could stick with the one anchor that is always available to you: your breath. Notice as it quickens or slows, and return to it whenever you find your mind drifting to a thought about that text message you forgot to answer, or the milk you accidentally left on the countertop.
                Harmonizing your mind and body is powerful. You’re making strides—figuratively and literally—for your physical and mental health. With that reward potential, a sweaty mindfulness session might be easier to put permanently on the calendar.

       <b><h5 class="p-5">8 Ways to Bring Mindfulness to Your Exercise Routine:</h5></b>
              <br>
              <ol>
                <li><h5 class="p1"><b>Pause and consider your purpose. </b> Remember why you want to meditate. Is it to train your mind to focus and sustain attention? To learn to navigate emotions? Consider your intention for exercise, too. Is it to live longer or have more energy? This twofold motivation can help get you up and out, and keep you going.</h5></li>
                <br>
                <li><h5 class="p1"> <b>Unplug.</b> To meditate during exercise, don’t listen to your favorite playlist, talk on the phone, read a magazine, or watch TV. Be fully present where you are: in the woods, on the sidewalk, or on the treadmill.</h5></li>
                <br>
                <li><h5 class="p1"> <b>Note your surroundings</b> There are two aspects of directing attention—focused attention and open awareness—and you can practice both while exercising. To tap in to the latter, check out what’s around you. How is the air? Temperature? What are you hearing?</h5></li>
                <br>
                <li><h5 class="p1"> <b>Exercise kindness</b>  Notice the quality of your thinking during workouts: Can you appreciate your current ability, speed, and endurance just as they are? If you work out in an in-person or virtual group, can you let go of the “comparing mind” and instead thank yourself for showing up for this healthy activity?</h5></li>

          <u><b><h5 class="heading text-center ">A 10-Minute Mindful Movement Practice to Ease into Sleep</h5></b></u>
          <br>
          <br>
          <h5 class="p1">There have been some studies looking into whether mindfulness and other meditative movements like those found in yoga, tai chi, and qi gong, can improve sleep quality. According to one review of studies taking a few minutes to settle your mind and body before bed can help you fall asleep faster as well as help you get more restful sleep.</h5>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h5 class="p1">There’s still a need for more high-quality research. One review of 1,049 studies on meditative movement and sleep outcomes found only 14 studies worthy of being included in the review. Of those 14, the results showed that mindful movement interventions led to significantly better sleep quality.</h5>
 <br>
 <br>
 <h5 class="p1 ">While we wait for the research community to provide more definitive answers, it seems it’s definitely worth giving mindful movement a try if you have trouble sleeping.</h5>

 <b><h3 class="p-3">Cat/Cow
  :</h3></b>
  <h5 class="p1 ">This movement stretches your upper back and loosens tension down your spine. Place your hands on the ground beneath your shoulders and your knees on the ground beneath your hips, keep your back straight and your head forward. As you inhale gently drop your belly toward the floor, lift your chest and look forward arching your spine slightly. As you exhale bring your face toward your navel while doming your upper spine, rounding the top of your back. Repeat for 3-5 breaths.</h5>

    :</h3></b>  
    <h5 class="p1 ">From an all-fours position, step your right foot forward and slide your left knee further behind you. Place your hands on your knee. This deep lunge stretches the front of your hips, an area that gets tight after a day of sitting. Hold for five breaths. Switch sides.</h5>

    <b><h3 class="p-3">Seated Neck Stretch

      <h5 class="p1 ">Have a seat and cross your legs if you can. Bring your right hand over your head and place it on your left ear. Gently drop your right ear towards your shoulder. Hold for five breaths. Bring your head back to center gently, and switch sides, going easy on your neck when you switch.</h5>
